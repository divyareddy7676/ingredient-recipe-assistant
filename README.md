# 🧺 Ingredient-Based Recipe Assistant

This is my GenAI Capstone project for the 5-Day Generative AI Kaggle course.

It uses:

- 🤖 Gemini API for natural language understanding
- 🧠 LangGraph agent to manage interaction
- 📋 Structured recipe generation and evaluation
- 🧲 FAISS + Embeddings for RAG-style memory

## 🔍 What It Does

Give it a prompt like:

> "I want a Mexican dinner with rice and beef"

And it will return:

- A recipe summary
- Ingredient list
- Step-by-step instructions
- Evaluation for ease + nutrition
